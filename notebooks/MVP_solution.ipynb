For example: what if you normalized the `price` feature by the mean residential property value in dollars per square foot for the 5 boroughs? You also could probably calculate an estimated listing age from the total reviews and the reviews per month. Be creative and do experiments. I was able to improve linear regression performance on price from under 50% of variance explained to almost 60% by adding polynomial combinations of the features to the data (see detailed solution notebooks).\n"
